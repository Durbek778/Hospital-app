    <string name="lorem_ipsum">" The basic trend of Korean art through the ages has been naturalistic,
        a characteristic already evident as early as the Three Kingdoms period (c. 57 BCE–668 CE) but
        fully established by the Unified, or Great, Silla (Korean: Shinla) period (668–935). The traditional
        attitude of accepting nature as it is resulted in a highly developed appreciation for the simple and unadorned.
        Korean artists, for example, favoured the unadorned beauty of raw materials, such as the natural patterns of wood grains.
        The Korean potter was characteristically unconcerned about mechanical perfection of his surfaces, curves, or shapes.
        His concern was to bring out the inherent or natural characteristics of his materials and the medium.
        Potters, therefore, were able to work unselfconsciously and naturally, producing wares of engaging simplicity and artistic distinctiveness." </string>
